### Default
- 3_20.hmm, default German acoustic model
- 3_20_hsb.hmm, default German model reduced to HSB phoneme inventory
- feainfo.object, feature extraction info object

### Adapted
- 3_20_adp.hmm, German model adapted with HSB audio data
- 3_20_hsb_adp.hmm, HSB model adapted with HSB audio data
- 3_20_cv_adp.hmm, German model adapted with HSB Common Voice audio data
- 3_20_cv_hsb_adp.hmm, HSB model adapted with HSB Common Voice audio data
- final.hmm, reduced HSB model adapted with HSB+CV audio data
- feainfo.object, feature extraction info object
